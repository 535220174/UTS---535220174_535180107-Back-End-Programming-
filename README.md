# Online Shop

I designed and developed an online shop where users can browse and purchase products. The shop features a catalog of products, a shopping cart, and a checkout process.

The back-end of the shop is built with NodeJS and uses MongoDB to store information about the products and users. The front-end is built with HTML and CSS, and I used the EJS to dynamically render the HTML pages on the server-side. I also incorporated Vanilla JavaScript to add interactive and dynamic elements to the website.

One of the key challenges I faced while building the shop was ensuring that the user experience was smooth and seamless. To achieve this, I paid close attention to the design and layout of the website, using responsive design techniques to ensure that the shop is mobile-friendly and easy to navigate.

In addition to the core features of the shop, I also implemented a number of additional features to enhance the user experience. These include:

-  A search bar that allows users to easily find specific products [TBD]
-  A catalog of products, including images, descriptions, and pricing
-  The ability to add and remove items from the shopping cart
-  A checkout process that calculates the total cost and allows the user to enter their shipping and payment information
-  A simple and intuitive user interface

Overall, I am very proud of the online shop that I have built. I believe it is a strong demonstration of my full-stack web development skills.
