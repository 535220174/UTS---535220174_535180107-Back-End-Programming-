# Online Shop

### [Live Demo](https://online-shop-essentials.cyclic.app/)

This is an online shop built using Node.js, EJS, MongoDB, and the Stripe API. The shop has two user stories: one for customers to place orders and one for admins to update products and fulfill orders. The application also uses an S3 bucket to store and upload images of products.

One of the key challenges I faced while building the shop was ensuring that the user experience was smooth and seamless. To achieve this, I paid close attention to the design and layout of the website, using responsive design techniques to ensure that the shop is mobile-friendly and easy to navigate.

In addition to the core features of the shop, I also implemented a number of additional features to enhance the user experience:

## User Stories
### Customer
As a customer, you can do the following:

- Browse products
- Add products to cart
- Change quantity of the product to buy before checkout
- Checkout and place orders
- View order history and status


### Admin
As an admin, you can do the following:

- Add, update, and delete products
- View all orders and their status
- Update order status (e.g. mark as fulfilled, cancelled)

Overall, I am very proud of the online shop that I have built. I believe it is a strong demonstration of my full-stack web development skills.
